3. Consistency : Docker containers ensure that the same software enviroment is used across diffrent system, which helps  to avoid the “it works on my machine” problem.
4. Efficiency : Which helps to improve the application perfornance and reduce infrastructure costs.
5. Flexibility : Docker supports wide range of programming languages.
